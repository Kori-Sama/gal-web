# This is a galgame website built for a private community

## Tech stack we are using

- **Next.js**: our core framework in this website
- **Drizzle**: the ORM we use to operate database
- **Postgresql**: the main database
- **tailwind**: the atom css (I really like it)
- **Shadcn**: the style-less component library

## How to start

```shell
# dev
npm run dev    # start a dev server

# production
npm run build  # compile and build
npm run start  # start a server
```

## Our authorization system

1. You need a invite key to register a account in our website.
2. The invite keys can be generated by administers.
3. If the invite keys come from the root administer, the user will become a administer after registering.
4. So you will find there are three different roles in our website: normal user, administer and root administer.
